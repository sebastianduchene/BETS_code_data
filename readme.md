## Raw data and simulated data sets for: Assessing the effect of model specification and prior sensitivity on Bayesian tests of temporal signal

- cholera_aln.fasta - sequence alignment for _V. cholerae_ data set.
- powassan_alignment.fasta - sequence alignment for _Powassan virus_ data set.
- treponema.fasta - sequence alignment for _T. pallidum_ data set.
- small_simulations* - these folders contain the xml files for simulations under the corresponding prior on the population size parameter of the constant-size coalescent.

All analyses were conducted with BEASTv1.10.5 pre-release (now BEASTv10.5.0).

No additional packages are required.
